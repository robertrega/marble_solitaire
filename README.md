#marble_solitaire

Please see an explanation of how the game is played here:

https://www.webgamesonline.com/peg-solitaire/

The user plays by running the main function in MarbleSolitaire.java through the IDE and then inputting moves through the command line. To start a game, the user can input parameters specifying the board type and size as well as the location of the initial empty space. Enter these followed by the word "go". If none is selected, then the game will begin with a default board. Any invalid input will throw errors and alert the user. All functions are documented in the code. Also included is a full test suite.
